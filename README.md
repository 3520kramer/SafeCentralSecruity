# SafeCentralSecruity
Exam project for the second semester exam in Software Construction, Software design, Tech and IT and the organization

We made a system for a newly started security company. 
The company needed a way to store the employees and customers information, create a shift schedule, manage wages and so on. We also includede a login form, a search form to search for employees and customers and a notice board where the managers could reach out to their staff

The system was developed by Nadia Oubelaid, Mads Frederiksen, Kasper Lydeking and myself.
